# Huffman-Tree
My own implementation of the Huffman-Tree. The [Huffman Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) is an implementation of a simple encoding and decoding of a file using zero's and one's, i.e. a compression file. This is my own twist/taste into how I use programmed the [Huffman Tree](http://huffmantree.com/)
